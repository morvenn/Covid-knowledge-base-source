        <p>The most common adverse reactions in participants aged 16 years or older were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>injection site pain (&gt;80%),</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>fatigue (&gt;60%),</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>headache (&gt;50%),</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>muscle pain and chills (&gt;30%),</p>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
