        <h1>Additional information</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">If you experience serious symptoms, contact your doctor immediately. Call and make an appointment before visiting your doctor or medical facility. People with mild symptoms and no other medical conditions should manage their symptoms at home.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">However, remember that the incubation period of the virus (the time from infection to the first symptoms of illness) lasts up to 14 days (5 - 6 days on average). The carrier of the virus may not know that he or she is ill and may pose a danger to themselves and other people. There have also been cases in which fever does not occur at all or other symptoms such as diarrhoea appear.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Most patients (81%) may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Unfortunately, in some patients coronavirus can lead to <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Covid-19-Glossary.Term8">pneumonia</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, multiple organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and even death.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">With the emergence of the 'British' variant of coronavirus, new symptoms of the disease have emerged. Taste and smell disorders are less frequent, while flu-like symptoms are more frequent: cough, fatigue, sore throat and muscles, fever, sinus problems. In addition, a very dangerous symptom of the disease is the absence of symptoms, which does not mean a mild course of COVID-19.</p>
