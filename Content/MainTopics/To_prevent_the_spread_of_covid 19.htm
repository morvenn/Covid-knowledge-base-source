        <h1>To prevent the spread of COVID-19</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Wash your hands frequently - at least several times a day and every time you come home from outdoors. Use soapy water and an alcohol-based disinfectant.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Keep a safe distance (1,5 - 2 metres) from people coughing and sneezing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Wear a mask when distance is not possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you cough or sneeze, cover your nose and mouth with the inside of your elbow or a tissue.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you feel unwell, stay at home.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, contact your doctor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For a quick referral to the right medical facility, call your nearest GP surgery in advance. This ensures you are protected and prevents the spread of viruses and other infectious agents.</p>
