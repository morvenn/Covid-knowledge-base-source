        <h1>Masks</h1>
        <p>Masks can help prevent the transmission of viruses from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19 - you should also keep your distance from other people and take care with hand hygiene. Follow the recommendations of your local health and epidemiological station.</p>
        <p>There are many types of masks you can use to protect yourself and others from getting and spreading COVID-19. When choosing a mask, choose one that fits snugly. Available types of masks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Cloth masks (made from a variety of fabrics)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Disposable face masks</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>KN95 masks (type of filtering facepiece respirator)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Masks are a critical step to help prevent people from getting and spreading COVID-19. A cloth mask offers some protection to you as well as protecting those around you. Wear a mask and take every day preventive actions in public settings and mass transportation, at events and gatherings, and anywhere you will be around other people.</p>
