        <h1>What if the contact was close?</h1>
        <p>First of all - don't panic. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If the contact with the infected person was closer than 2 metres and longer than 15 minutes (being in the same room, direct conversation),</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>if there was physical contact (e.g. shaking hands, touching a used tissue, exposure to coughing),</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>...there is a greater likelihood of infection.</p>
