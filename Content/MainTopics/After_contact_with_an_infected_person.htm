        <h1>What to do after contact with a person infected with COVID-19?</h1>
        <p>Inform <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Covid-19-Glossary.Term0">The Social Insurance Institution</MadCap:glossaryTerm> by telephone about the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Covid-19-Glossary.Term3">quarantine</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, and they should do the rest. You do not need an electronic sick note or a certificate from the health authorities. However, it is worth notifying your boss by e-mail or telephone of the reason for your absence from work.</p>
        <p>If, however, there is no information for your employer in the system - make a statement about being in quarantine. You have 3 days from the end of the quarantine to do this.</p>
        <p>The statement should include some essential information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Your personal details (name, <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Covid-19-Glossary.Term2">PESEL</MadCap:glossaryTerm> number, ID card or passport series and number),</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The day the compulsory quarantine started and the day it ended,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Your signature.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have no symptoms, you will end the quarantine after 10 days.</p>
        <p>Remember to monitor how you feel. If you feel worse and have symptoms of COVID-19 - call your GP. They will assess your health and make a referral for testing if necessary.</p>
